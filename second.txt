The ONLY 4 steps you need to remember (forever)
1️⃣ Edit / Create files (local)

Example:

Edit README.md

Or create test.py

2️⃣ Commit (local history)

In PyCharm:

Open Commit panel

Select files

Write message:

Updated README


Click Commit (or Commit and Push)

📌 Commit = save changes locally

3️⃣ Push (send to GitHub)

Click Push

If already logged in → no popup

Done 🚀

📌 Push = upload to GitHub

4️⃣ Verify (optional but good habit)

Open GitHub in browser

Refresh repo page

See updated file ✔️
